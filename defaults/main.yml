# Start service after a given target. This is here because we want to define common

# The systemD services dictionary is a set of services that will be created. The dictionary
#  can contain the following options:
#  `service_name` -- (required) used to define the name of the service. This is typically the name of the executable.
#  `init_config_overrides` -- (optional) This allows any section or key=value pair to be set within the systemd unit file.
#  `program_config_options` -- (optional) Provides the ability to pass in flags to a given service for execution.
#  `program_override` -- (optional) sets the full path to the executable that will be run by the service file.

#  Examples:
#   systemd_services:
#     ServiceW:
#       service_name: ServiceW
#       init_config_overrides: {}  # This is used to add in arbitratry unit file options
#     ServiceX:
#       service_name: ServiceX
#       init_config_overrides: {}  # This is used to add in arbitratry unit file options
#       program_config_options: '--flag1 things --flag2 other'
#     ServiceY:
#       service_name: ServiceY
#       init_config_overrides: {}  # This is used to add in arbitratry unit file options
#       program_override: '/usr/bin/ServiceY'
