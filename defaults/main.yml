# The systemd services dictionary is a set of services that will be created. The dictionary
#  can contain the following options:
#  `service_name` -- (required) used to define the name of the service. This is typically the name of the executable.
#  `init_config_overrides` -- (optional) This allows any section or key=value pair to be set within the systemd unit file.
#  `program_config_options` -- (optional) Provides the ability to pass in flags to a given service for execution.
#  `program_override` -- (optional) sets the full path to the executable that will be run by the service file.
#  `enabled` -- (optional) Set the enabled state of the service.
#  `state` -- (optional) Set the running state of the service.
